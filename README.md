Install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Load the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, or irrelevant columns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and summarize the data.
4. **Insights Extraction**: Analyze trends, correlations, and patterns.
5. **Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs for better understanding.
